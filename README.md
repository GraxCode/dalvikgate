Dalvikgate is a lightweight dalvik to java bytecode converter by Col-E and noverify (a.k.a. GraxCode) written in java 8. 
It uses dexlib2 and asm-tree to translate the code and is still work in progress. 
Dalvikgate is intended for DEX up to version 39, but should work on newer versions too. ODEX files are also supported.
